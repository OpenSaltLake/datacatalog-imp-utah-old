:description: "This geologic map allows viewers to see the geology   in three dimensions (3-D). We created an overlay of the new geologic map of   the St. George 30' x 60' quadrangle (the map is currently in the final stages   of review) that can be draped over the landscape on virtual globes such as   Google Earth\xE2\x84\xA2."
